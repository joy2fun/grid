Create migrations for the following tables. Keep column names short—ideally one word.
 - A table named stocks to store each stock’s code and a friendly name.
 - A table named day_prices to store daily prices for stocks. No timestamps are needed.
Also, create a Filament resource page for the stocks so I can manage them.
